    <h2>Egg Crack Game (Summer Scratch practice)</h2>
    <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/726262065/editor">Egg Crack Game</a></p>
    <p>The “Egg crack game” was the first game I coded, and this was a part of my summer work. I was instructed to make
      a game using scratch that included a plethora of different code elements. I am aware that there are many ways that
      it could be improved and that the code is inefficient. Nonetheless, I still think its cool I made it with little
      prior knowledge. It took me a long time to make and I dont like spending a long time on the same task, so it was
      challenging for me. It was also challenging for me to combine everything I had learned from the first 8 lessons
      and put it all together. It ended up teaching me a lot because in the end I had better knowledge on things fit
      together. </p>

    <h2>SNAP Project "Asterisks and polygon"</h2>
    
    <p>This is probably the most visually appealing SNAP project ive made so far, and I also feel like it was the first thing I created with SNAP that actually worked properly. The goal was to have a sprite draw pinwheels, polygons and asterisks in the size, shape and color that the user wants. I struggled with creating pinwheels, but after I had done the code for the pinwheels creating the code for the asterisks and polygons was relatively easy. I learned a lot more about how loops work with this project, and although it took some frustrating trial and error it taught me the basics of SNAP. When I look back on the project it seems super simple but at the time it was challenging.

    <h2>Congressional App Challenge 2022</h2>
    <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=katepags&ProjectName=Katelyn%20%26%20Jadzia%20-%20Organ%20Guessing%20Game"> App Challenge</a></p>
   
    <p>This program's purpose is to teach those who are not familiar with the functions of the bodily organs about the organs and their functions. The program is intended to be educational while being fun which is why it is in a game format. The program allows the user to play a matching game to learn which organ is where on the body and then allows them to test the knowledge they learned in the matching game with a quiz game.  </p>

    <h2>AP Create task Final (Planner)</h2>
    
    <p>This program is an online planner that was coded using SNAP. This program serves as a planner app that the user can use however they see fit. The app was created with the purpose of giving the user a place where they can jot down reminders or plans that they otherwise might forget without the use of the app. The user inputs the name of a task, and then the week day and time of day that their task will occur at. The user can then search the name of their task, and the program will then output what time and day their task is scheduled for.
