    <h2>Egg Crack Game (Summer Scratch practice)</h2>
    <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/726262065/editor">Egg Crack Game</a></p>
    <p>The “Egg crack game” was the first game I coded, and this was a part of my summer work. I was instructed to make
      a game using scratch that included a plethora of different code elements. I am aware that there are many ways that
      it could be improved and that the code is inefficient. Nonetheless, I still think its cool I made it with little
      prior knowledge. It took me a long time to make and I dont like spending a long time on the same task, so it was
      challenging for me. It was also challenging for me to combine everything I had learned from the first 8 lessons
      and put it all together. It ended up teaching me a lot because in the end I had better knowledge on things fit
      together. </p>

    <h2>SNAP Project "Asterisks and polygon"</h2>
    
    <p>This is probably the most visually appealing SNAP project ive made so far, and I also feel like it was the first thing I created with SNAP that actually worked properly. The goal was to have a sprite draw pinwheels, polygons and asterisks in the size, shape and color that the user wants. I struggled with creating pinwheels, but after I had done the code for the pinwheels creating the code for the asterisks and polygons was relatively easy. I learned a lot more about how loops work with this project, and although it took some frustrating trial and error it taught me the basics of SNAP. When I look back on the project it seems super simple but at the time it was challenging.
